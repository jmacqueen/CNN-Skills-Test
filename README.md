CNN-Skills-Test
===============

My skills test for CNN. AKA "From zero to basic node.js plus Twitter in 4 hours."

Thank goodness my client-side Javascript is pretty solid :-)

The application resides in app.js.

This was my very first experience with node.js, so this was fun! With the holidays fast upon me, I only had the time to do two of the extra credit pieces. The router will be next if I get the chance. Probably after the due date :-)

I chose to put the tweets into two different ```<div>``` elements so that they would show up in the proper order when shown in two columns. My initial approach of just resizing and floating the ```<p>``` tags meant that the two column view had the tweets read left-to-right instead of vertically...which seemed weird to me.

I also fixed the truncating of the text in the re-tweets. I didn't notice that one until one of my links showed up broken! Sneaky!

Thanks!
