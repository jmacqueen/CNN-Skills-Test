CNN-Skills-Test
===============

My skills test for CNN. AKA "From zero to basic node.js plus Twitter in 3 hours."

Thank goodness my overall Javascript is pretty solid :-)

This was my very first experience with node.js, so that code isn't as organized as I would like, with
everything basically lumped into the routing callback. With the holidays fast upon me, I only had
the time to do the one piece of extra credit of activating the links in the tweets.
The router will be next if I get the chance.

And I *hate* that I have entirely inline html. If I can get a chance to hop back on this before the deadline
I'll fix that, too. But for now I want to make sure I get something live in case I don't get back
into this in time.

Thanks!
